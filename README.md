## Introduction

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. In JavaScript, the combination of Chai and Mocha is a popular choice for implementing TDD. This README provides an overview of TDD with Chai and Mocha.

## Getting Started

To start practicing TDD with Chai and Mocha in JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. **Project Setup**: Create a new JavaScript project or navigate to an existing one.

3. **Install Chai and Mocha**: Use npm to install Chai and Mocha as development dependencies in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install chai mocha --save-dev
